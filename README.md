#Creative Brief

==Project Overview==


This individual project aims to develop a web application specifically designed to support individuals with ADHD and other mental health conditions. The application will combine a user-friendly front end, a robust back end, and advanced artificial intelligence functionalities to provide personalized and effective support for users.
Still, there is many ADHD tools to manage time or tasks, however, they are not based on psychological ground, or neurological ground.

Back End

API Development: Create RESTful APIs to handle client requests and interact with AI models.

Database Management: Use a robust database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to manage user data, AI model data, and other relevant information.

Security: Implement strong security measures, including encryption, authentication, and authorization protocols, to protect sensitive user data.

Scalability: Design the back end to handle a growing number of users and data efficiently, utilizing cloud services like AWS or Azure.
